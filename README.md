# Virtual_Rehab

We address the issue of declining motivation in people with limited finger movement which
frequently results in a discontinuation of rehabilitation therapies through our project, VR
(Virtual Rehab). Current research on the recovery from stroke and paralysis emphasizes the
value of early and ongoing therapy for higher recovery rates. We have created a special
solution to address this issue and offer ongoing therapy motivation. Our gadget makes use
of sensor technology that is attached to a microcontroller and built into a glove. Dynamic
threshold values are programmed into the controller so that when sensors pick up
predefined movements, they will send out particular signals. The corresponding actions in a
Unity 3D VR environment are triggered by these signals. The player's character in our virtual
reality game reacts to movements picked up by the glove that has a flex sensor. So that they
would try to continue therapy regularly
